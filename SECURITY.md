# üîí VeroSports Security Policy

## üìã Overview

At VeroSports, we take security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and the security measures implemented across our platform.

## ‚úÖ Supported Versions

| Latest release | ‚úÖ Active | 12 months after release |
| Previous releases | ‚ùå Unsupported | - |

Unsupported versions will not receive security updates. We strongly recommend using the latest version for optimal security protection.

## üîç Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting Channels

Please do **not** open a GitHub issue for security reports as this could expose vulnerabilities to potential attackers.

Instead, email all security vulnerabilities to:

```
security@verosports.com
```

### Report Requirements

Your report should include:
- Affected version or commit hash
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant code or proof-of-concept

- Suggested mitigations (optional)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Response Process

1. **Triage (1-3 days)**
   - Reports are reviewed and prioritized based on severity using CVSS scoring
   - An initial assessment is communicated to the reporter

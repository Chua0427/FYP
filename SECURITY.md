# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently maintain security support for the `main` branch. Published releases are supported for 12 months after their initial release.

Unsupported versions will not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a GitHub issue for security reports.
Instead, email all security vulnerabilities to:

```
security@verosports.com
```

Your report should include:
- Affected version or commit hash
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant code or proof-of-concept

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for a fix.

## Security Response Process

1. **Triage**: Reports are reviewed and prioritized based on severity.
2. **Fix**: A patch is developed and tested.
3. **Release**: A new release containing the fix is published and announced.
4. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure (e.g., release notes, advisories) occurs when the fix is generally available.

## Supported Communication

All security correspondence is kept confidential until a fix is released. Thank you for helping us keep VeroSports safe!
